Overview: Developed a robust web application for tracking and trading Indian stocks, utilizing financial APIs to access real-time market data. The project was built with Laravel, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and MySQL.

Market Data Retrieval: Integrated a financial API to fetch comprehensive details of Indian stocks, enabling users to view live market prices and stock information.

Stock Trading Features: Implemented functionality for users to buy stocks based on live market prices, categorized by market capitalization (small, mid, large) to help analyze risk levels and potential rewards.

Portfolio Management: After purchasing stocks, users can view their investments on an index page organized by market cap. The system displays real-time profit/loss for individual stocks, including the purchase price, current price, and percentage changes.

Investment Overview: Designed an index page featuring cards that summarize overall investment amounts, total profit/loss, and XIRR percentages based on stock categorization.

Stock Averaging and Exit: Enabled users to average down their stock purchases and customize exits. Users can sell a specified quantity of stocks, with profits and losses calculated and displayed on a dedicated report page.

Profit/Loss Reporting: Created a detailed profit/loss report page that shows realized profits and losses based on market cap, providing valuable insights into trading performance.

Data Visualization: Developed a charting feature to compare XIRR percentages across small, mid, and large-cap stocks, allowing users to visualize investment performance.

Learning Focus: The project utilizes dummy or paper amounts for investment, ensuring that users can learn stock trading without any financial risk, while still working with real investment data.
